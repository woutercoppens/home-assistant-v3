## INTRODUCTION

Requires the new pyHAopenmotics v0.0.1 (or newer) sdk.

## HOW TO INSTALL

### 1. Grant permissions to your OpenMotics installation

Login to [cloud.openmotics.com](https://cloud.openmotics.com/)

Copy the Client ID and Client secret as you'll need it to configure the integration in Home Assistant.

### 2. Install Home Assistant Core

See [Home Assistant Official Installation Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) to install Home Assistant Core.

### 3. Install the custom integration

We highly recommend using [HACS Home Assistant Community Store](https://github.com/hacs), for more information on how to install HACS please see their documentation website at https://hacs.xyz/

Option 2: HACS installation

1. See [HACS Official Installation Guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/installation/installation/) and install HACS.

Option 1:  Manual Code Installation

This method is best used when you want to play with the "latest and greatest" from the repository. Moving forward, the github repository will contain two primary branches, **master** and dev. Master is the latest released, and hopefully most stable branch, whereas **dev** is the branch that we're currently working on.


1. Download the [openmotics-home-assistant repo](https://github.com/openmotics/home-assistant).
2. Unzip it and copy the `custom_components/openmotics` folder to the Home Assistant configuration directory, for example `~/.homeassistant`.

![configuration directory](/pictures/copy_method.png)

The disadvantage of a manual installation is that you won't be notified about updates.

### 4. Configure the integration.

Make sure you restart Home Assistant after the installation (in HACS). After the restart, go to **Configuration** in the side menu in Home Assistant and select **Integrations**. Click on **Add Integrations** in the bottom right corner and search for **Openmotics** to install. This will open the configuration menu with the default settings.

![Integration setup](/pictures/integration_setup.png)

Fill in the user_id and secret_id you have created in the first step.

Depending on your installation, the modules should be added to your Home Assistant automatically within a few seconds till 10 minutes.
